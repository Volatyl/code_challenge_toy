## CHALLENGE 1: STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR

This programme takes in a value 'marks' and then grades it according to the given cliteria.
Marks has to be an integer and for that the type of input is number. It also has to be more than 0 and less or equal to 100 hence the range limitations.

The button labeled 'GET GRADE' calls the function showGrade() which checks the marks input and returns the grade.
In the script file we have the functions that handles the grading.
