## CHALLENGE 1: STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR

This programme takes in a value 'marks' and then grades it according to the given cliteria.
Marks has to be an integer and for that the type of input is number. It also has to be more than 0 and less or equal to 100 hence the range limitations.

The button labeled 'GET GRADE' calls the function showGrade() which checks the marks input and returns the grade.
In the script file we have the functions that handles the grading.

## CHALLENGE 2 : SPEED DETECTOR
This program takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it give the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it will print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function will print: “License suspended”.
